The Bowl exceeded all my expectations! The poke bowls are incredibly fresh, and you can tell they use high-quality ingredients. The salmon practically melted in my mouth. The staff was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was vibrant yet relaxing. I'll definitely be coming back with friends and family. Five stars!

I was really disappointed with my experience at The Bowl. The wait time was over 45 minutes even though the restaurant wasn't that busy. When my food finally arrived, the rice was cold and the fish tasted like it had been sitting out. The server seemed completely uninterested in helping us. I won't be returning.

Decent food but nothing special. The prices are a bit steep for what you get. The tuna bowl was okay, but I've had better at other places. The location is convenient though, and parking is easy to find. It's fine for a quick lunch, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.

Absolutely love The Bowl! This is my third visit this month, and every time the food has been consistently delicious. The mango salsa they add to the chicken bowl is to die for. Great portion sizes too - I always leave satisfied. The only minor complaint is that it can get pretty loud during peak hours, but that's a small price to pay for such amazing food.

Review 5:
Terrible experience. Found a hair in my food and when I complained, the manager was dismissive and rude. They offered a 10% discount instead of replacing the meal. The hygiene standards here are clearly lacking. I've reported them to the health department. Avoid this place at all costs.

The Bowl is our family's new favorite restaurant! The kids' menu options are healthy and actually taste good - my picky eater devoured his bowl. The vegetarian options are creative and flavorful. We appreciate that they clearly label allergens on the menu. The staff was patient with our large group and even brought out a birthday dessert for my daughter. Highly recommend!

Mixed feelings about The Bowl. The food quality is good, but the service was slow and they got my order wrong twice. The spicy tuna bowl I ordered came out as a regular tuna bowl, and when they fixed it, they forgot my side of edamame. The manager apologized and comped my drink, which I appreciated. I might give them another chance on a less busy day.

Perfect spot for a healthy lunch! The build-your-own bowl option lets you customize everything exactly how you want it. Fresh ingredients, reasonable prices, and quick service. The green goddess dressing is addictive. My coworkers and I come here at least once a week. Keep up the great work!
