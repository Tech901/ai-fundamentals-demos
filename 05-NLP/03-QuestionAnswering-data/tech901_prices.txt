CANCELLATIONS AND REFUNDS:
Tech901 trainees have a lot going on. We understand that you may need to cancel your registration. Prior to 20% completion of class, trainees are eligible to a full refund of tuition (including any fees). Students who choose to withdraw from a Tech901 course are asked to do so by completing a withdrawal form online at: https://info.tech901.org/withdrawal. Refunds will be processed within two weeks of the date of withdrawal.

All courses will include at least one graded test or project before the 20% completion mark of the course (e.g. week 3 in a 12-week course) to ensure students are able to withdraw and receive a refund if necessary.

Please note: trainees who withdraw or are administratively withdrawn due to attendance from two Tech901 classes will no longer be eligible for future Tech901 courses.
