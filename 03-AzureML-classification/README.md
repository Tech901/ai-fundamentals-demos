# Resources for AzureML classification

So we trained an ML Classification model on MPD Citation data with the goal of predicting _race_!

_Was this a good idea or not?_

- `data/` contains data that was used for model training
- `classifcation-inferency.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that shows how to use an API endpoint to run model inference.
- `data-analysis.ipynb` illustrates how to perform statistical (and perhaps necessary) preliminary analysis of a data set before training a model.
